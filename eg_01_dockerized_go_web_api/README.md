# Docker Basics â€“ Go Web API Example
This repository contains a simple Go API to demonstrate containerization using Docker.  
The main goal is to learn how Docker works, focusing on building efficient container images.

## What this project does
- Provides a minimal Go API with one health check endpoint (`/healtz`)  
- Uses a Docker multi-stage build to create a small, efficient image  
- Runs the app inside a lightweight Alpine Linux container  

## How to use

1. **Clone ther repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abanu-H/docker-go-samples.git
```
2. **Navigate to the exercise directory**
```bash
cd docker-go-samples/eg_01_dockerized_go_web_api
```
3. **Build the Docker image**
```bash
docker build -t dockerized_go_web_api .
```
4. **Run the container**
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 dockerized_go_web_api
```
Server starts at http://localhost:3000.

5. **Test the app**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/healtz
```

We could see:
App is Up and Running Successfully
